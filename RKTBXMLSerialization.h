/**
 Provides a basic XML implementation using an adapted version
 of the TBXML class by "Insert-Witty-Name" available at:
 https://github.com/mackoj/TBXML-NSDictionary

 `RKTBXMLSerialization` will parse an XML document into an NSDictionary
 representation suitable for use with RestKit's key-value coding based
 object mapping implementation.

 XML attributes are represented as keys in a dictionary.

 **NOTE** When an XML tag is parsed containing both XML attributes and
 an enclosed text node, the value of the text node will be inserted in
 the parsed dictionary at the `@"text"` key.
